I'm a front-end developer. Previously, I was a C++ developer for 10 years. Last two years, I write javascript code as a front end developer. Although I know HTML/CSS well, but I didn't write even one whole page (because my coworkers did these works). 

Now I want to work as a freelancer, so I have to write static pages myself. So I got some open source Bootstrap templates, learn them, and write the HTML/CSS to generate the nearly same web pages.

Here is my works distribution. You can view the pages:
